# Projection MultiDimension to 1D
In the present code we find the conversion of data from 10 dimensions to 1 dimension, the z-order is taken as criteria. Then, having converted these values, one is choose which will be compared to search its 5, 10, 15 and 20 nearest neighbors in 10 dimensions and in one dimension. Finally, we return the percentage of matching between these two projections.

During the code the explanation of each function is found in each step.
